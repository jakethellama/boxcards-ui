# BoxCards UI

### Overview

[BoxCards](https://boxcards.app) is a full-stack flashcard app. This UI is made with React.js and Tailwindcss. Also, I used Vite for developing and Vercel for hosting the frontend. 

In BoxCards, flashcards are represented as objects rather than raw text, meaning that you can reuse and share flashcards with ease! If you have a particular card in 2 different sets, changing that card in one set will affect that card in other set because its the same object. So, a set is basically a group of pointers to flashcard objects.
